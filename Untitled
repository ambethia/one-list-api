# One List API

Today we are going to connect the One List application to a backend API.

- View the API documentation: https://one-list-api.herokuapp.com
- Fork [One List](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-fee/one-list) to your own account.
- Clone it to you computer.

Our task is to persist all changes we make in the One List application to the API.

- When you load/reload One List, it should get list items from the API.
- When you create an item it should create the item via the API.
- When you complete an item it should complete the item via the API.
- When you remove an item it should remove the item via the API.
- Choose your own unique `access_token`!
